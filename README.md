### Current Objectives:
- [x] Build out basic audio recording funcitonality for `Nimbus` wake-word data collection
- [x] Add ability for user to select specific audio recording to play back
- [ ] Add button to upload to Google Drive

### Miscellaneous
It should be noted that this project is in a very crude state and does not properly conform to the MVC ideology. This will be addressed in further iterations.
